# RRT-algortihm

I implemented an RRT (Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree) function to guide a robot to landmarks generated by the RRT algorithm. The function calculated a smooth and efficient trajectory for the robot to follow, using RRT to identify the optimal path from the start to the goal. The implementation involved combining RRT techniques with robotics principles to create a solution that can be used in various real-world scenarios. This project allowed me to demonstrate my skills in robotics, algorithm design, and programming. 12/06/2022
